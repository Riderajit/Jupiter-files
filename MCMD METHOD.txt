* MCDM Approaches:
We will be covering the following :
. Saaty scale for heirarchy
. Piarwise matrices to determine weights

*MCDM method in 4 ste:- ps
. Saaty scale :- We use ths scale to dertermine importances.
.Chooe the variables :- Identify the variable for the given problem statement.
.Determine the weights of each variable:- We use pairwise matrices to get the weighs/coefficients for each variable
.Arrive at the final score using weights :- Once we arrive at the weights,we use these and evaluate each & every option.
